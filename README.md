# PinDrop

PinDrop allows you to securely share files with either devices on your network, or people on the internet. It has no size limit and is completely free to use.

## ðŸ¥ª Tech Stack

PinDrop utilizes the following technologies:

-   [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org)
-   [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
-   [Express.js](https://expressjs.com)
-   [PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps)

## ðŸ’» Self-Hosting

PinDrop currently is not made to be self-hosted. I do plan to add support for such things in the future using [Docker](https://docker.com).
